# Form with Web Components

This project is a **multi-step form** built with **React 19**, **Web Components**, and styled using **TailwindCSS**.  
The Web Components encapsulate form sections (e.g., accommodation, owner, etc.) and emit structured events that React listens to in order to manage step transitions and data flow.
